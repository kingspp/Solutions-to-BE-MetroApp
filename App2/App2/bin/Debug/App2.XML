            SuspensionManager captures global session state to simplify process lifetime management
            for an application.  Note that session state will be automatically cleared under a variety
            of conditions and should only be used to store information that would be convenient to
            carry across sessions, but that should be discarded when an application crashes or is
            upgraded.
